## Introduction {#sec-intro}

You can write your text using markdown.  

Top level section headings use ##

Notice use of curly braces to label a section if you want to later cross-reference to it.  #sec-  is required as part of the label


### Sub-heading Demo

You can use sub-headings in your paper as well

### Symbols and Equations

You can use quarto inline or display math equations as needed.  Quarto provides [details](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations) on the use of these equations.

For example $x$ and $y$ are two variables. And here is an important formula:

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ 

### Tables

Tables are generally created and output from notebooks in the /notebooks folder.  You can then embed these tables in your manuscript.

{{< embed notebooks/tables.qmd#table-1 >}}


Alternatively, this is an example of a simple table that is hard-coded using markdown table format.  We don't recommend this for tables built from data. Tables values should come directly from data so they don't need to be typed in and will update if your data change.  However, you may have other uses for simple tables where this method is helpful.

: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}



### Figures

Figures are also generally created in separate notebooks and embedded into your manuscript.

{{< embed notebooks/fig1.qmd#fig-1 >}}


We can also insert image files directly into our manuscript using images that are saved in the /images folder

![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}


### References

We can use cite relevant research in multiple formats.  The two most common are: 

- @marrero2019 concluded something.  
- These are the conclusions[@marrero2019].

Article references are stored in a .bib file using betterbibtex (BBT) format.  We create these references in Zotero collections.

Although we don't do this regularly I think, if needed you can 

- reference other sections in the paper (e.g., Methods are described in @sec-methods)
- reference figures elsewhere using the @ symbol.   Here is a reference to @fig-1


## Methods {#sec-methods}



## Results {#sec-results}

To add results that are not figures or tables, you will need to open the analysis objects you saved from these analyses.  See lm.qmd as an example. Generally you will open csv files that contain tidied results. For example
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

coeffs <- read_csv(here::here("notebooks/analysis_objects/coeff_table.csv"),
                   col_types = cols())
```

A significant effect of speed was observed ($\beta$ = `r sprintf("%1.1f", coeffs |> filter(term == "speed") |> pull(estimate))`, t = `r sprintf("%1.2f", coeffs |> filter(term == "speed") |> pull(statistic))`, p = `r sprintf("%1.3f", coeffs |> filter(term == "speed") |> pull(p.value))`).

NOTES: 

- We should write a function that works with tidied coeffs tables and takes the row, column, and number of decimal  places to make this code simpler.
- This table doesnt contain df.  Need to add that to table when saving in lm
