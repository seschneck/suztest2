## Title image
image.png shows file next to qmd  
 /images/image.png doesnt work (no image)  
 images/image.png shows qmd/images/  
 ../image.png gives 404 publish error (aka API error) even though there IS an image one folder up  

## Image tests{.smaller}

1. With no rproj loaded,  


a.   

Same directory as qmd:  (this works with publish)  
![](image.png)  

(sidebar - With Render, both of the below links find the image in qmd/images/ (same for the background!!)  
(actually no matter how many ../ it still finds this image )  


images/image.png (In subfolder under qmd) (this works with publish)      
![](images/image.png) https://seschneck.quarto.pub/imagetest/images/image.png  

../image.png:  (one directory up)   
![]("../image.png") 

![](../images/image.png) 

b. with publish the 2nd one is an error: ERROR: API Error: 404 - Not Found

c. changing 2nd one to ../../../images/image/png is a broken link but it still publishes. The link tries to point to https://seschneck.quarto.pub/images/image.png

d. Both (../../../images/image.png) and (../images/image.png) try to point to that same link!!

2. With rproj loaded:

(Render still gives you qmd/images here:)  
<!-- ![](../../images/image.png)   Causes API error -->
![](../images/image.png)  (Gives you https://seschneck.quarto.pub/images/image.png)

![](/images/image.png) 

![](/presentations/image.png) 

(https://seschneck.quarto.pub/imagetest/_presentations/test1/images/image.png) which is not found



3. With quarto project enabled and rProj off  

No difference than no rproj
