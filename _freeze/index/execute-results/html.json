Quarto provides [details](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations) on the use of these equations.\n\nFor example $x$ and $y$ are two variables. And here is an important formula:\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ \n\n### Tables\n\nTables are generally created and output from notebooks in the /notebooks folder.  You can then embed these tables in your manuscript.\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/tables.qmd#table-1 >}}\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, this is an example of a simple table that is hard-coded using markdown table format.  We don't recommend this for tables built from data. Tables values should come directly from data so they don't need to be typed in and will update if your data change.  However, you may have other uses for simple tables where this method is helpful.\n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Current             | 2021 |\n| Teneguía            | 1971 |\n| Nambroque           | 1949 |\n| El Charco           | 1712 |\n| Volcán San Antonio  | 1677 |\n| Volcán San Martin   | 1646 |\n| Tajuya near El Paso | 1585 |\n| Montaña Quemada     | 1492 |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n\n\n### Figures\n\nFigures are also generally created in separate notebooks and embedded into your manuscript.\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/fig1.qmd#fig-1 >}}\n\n\n\n\nWe can also insert image files directly into our manuscript using images that are saved in the /images folder\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\n\n### References\n\nWe can use cite relevant research in multiple formats.  The two most common are: \n\n- @marrero2019 concluded something.  \n- These are the conclusions[@marrero2019].\n\nArticle references are stored in a .bib file using betterbibtex (BBT) format.  We create these references in Zotero collections.\n\nAlthough we don't do this regularly I think, if needed you can \n\n- reference other sections in the paper (e.g., Methods are described in @sec-methods)\n- reference figures elsewhere using the @ symbol.   Here is a reference to @fig-1\n\n\n## Methods {#sec-methods}\n\n\n\n## Results {#sec-results}\n\nTo add results that are not figures or tables, you will need to open the analysis objects you saved from these analyses.  See lm.qmd as an example. Generally you will open csv files that contain tidied results. For example\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ncoeffs <- read_csv(here::here(\"notebooks/analysis_objects/coeff_table.csv\"),\n                   col_types = cols())\n```\n:::\n\n\nA significant effect of speed was observed ($\\beta$ = 3.9, t = 9.46, p = 0.000).\n\nNOTES: \n\n- We should write a function that works with tidied coeffs tables and takes the row, column, and number of decimal  places to make this code simpler.\n- This table doesnt contain df.  Need to add that to table when saving in lm\n\n\n## Discussion {#sec-discussion}\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
